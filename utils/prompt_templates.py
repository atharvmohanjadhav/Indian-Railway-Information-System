                    2. If there are **no direct trains**, or the direct options are very limited, then:
                    - Identify **possible connecting routes** via major junctions or intermediate stations.
                    - Suggest logical **via routes** (e.g., Source ➝ Junction ➝ Destination) that are practical and minimize total travel time.
                    - Include train names/numbers for each leg, if possible.

                    3. Present the information in a clear, structured format that is easy for the user to read.

                    Be clear and helpful. If real-time data is missing, politely remind the user to check the official railway site or app for final confirmation.
